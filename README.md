# R_programming_assignment3
This is the assignment 3 of Coursera course â€” R Programming.

## Introduction
The assignment is about creating programmes for filtering hospitals according to different conditions. The data for this assignment come from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov) run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data and information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. This dataset es- sentially covers all major U.S. hospitals. This dataset is used for a variety of purposes, including determining whether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality care to patients (see http://goo.gl/jAXFX for some background on this particular topic).

## Data
This assignment only look at a small subset of the data from the Hospital Compare web site. 
- _outcome-of-care-measures.csv_: Contains information about 30-day mortality and readmission rates for heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia for over 4,000 hospitals.
- _hospital-data.csv_: Contains information about each hospital.
- _Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf_: Descriptions of the variables in each file (i.e the code book).

## Codes
- _best_task2.csv_: Find the best hospital in a state
- _rankhospital_task3.csv_: Ranking hospitals by outcome in a state
- _rankall2_task4.csv_: Ranking hospitals in all states
